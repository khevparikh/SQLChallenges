# SQLChallenges

This repository showcases my solutions to the 8 case studies from the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), curated by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/). Through these challenges, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL, employing techniques such as recursive common table expressions (CTEs), window functions, and date and timestamp manipulation. Feel free to explore and gain insights into my coding approach.
